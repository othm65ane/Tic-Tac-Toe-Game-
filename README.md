# Tic Tac Toe Game in C
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, written in C. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

# Features
Two-Player Mode: Play against another person on the same computer.
Simple Text-Based Interface: Easy to use and understand, with prompts guiding the players.
Win and Draw Detection: Automatically detects when a player has won or if the game is a draw.
Replay Option: Option to start a new game after the current one ends.
